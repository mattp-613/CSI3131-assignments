A page-replacement algorithm should minimize the number of page faults. We can
achieve this minimization by distributing heavily used
pages evenly over all of memory, rather than having them compete for a small number of
page frames. We can associate with each page frame
a counter of the number of pages associated with that frame. Then, to replace a page, we
can search for the page frame with the smallest
counter.



a. Define a page-replacement algorithm using this basic idea. Specifically address
these problems:

i. What the initial value of the counters is

The initial values will all be zero.

ii. When counters are increased

Counter will be increased when a page frame encounters the same number it already has, so the one with the same number will be 
increased to a priority of 1 if it is the only one with priority 1, or priority 2 if there are two or more priorty 1 processes,
or 3 if there are two or more priority 2 processes, etc...

iii. When counters are decreased

Counters are reset to 0 when the page frame is replaced.

iv. How the page to be replaced is selected

FIFO with priority using the counter

b. How many page faults occur for your algorithm for the following reference string,
for four page frames?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 5, 4, 5, 4, 2.



c. What is the minimum number of page faults for an optimal page replacement
strategy for the reference string in part b with four page frames
